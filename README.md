### 🏥 **Chest Disease Detection using CNN**
**An AI-powered model for detecting Normal and Pneumonia conditions from chest X-rays.**  

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
This project aims to classify chest X-rays into **Normal** and **Pneumonia** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
The model is trained using the **Chest X-ray Dataset** available on Kaggle.  

---

## 📌 **Features**
✅ Detects **Normal vs. Pneumonia** in chest X-rays.  
✅ Built using **PyTorch & Torchvision**.  
✅ Supports **GPU acceleration (CUDA)** for faster training.  
✅ Implements **early stopping** to prevent overfitting.  
✅ Includes **Streamlit UI** for easy model testing.  

---

## 📂 **Dataset**
The dataset must be downloaded manually from Kaggle:  

🔗 **[Chest X-ray Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)**  

After downloading, place the dataset in the following directory structure:  

```
D:\Surgical AI assitant\brain\Chest\
│── train\
│   ├── Normal\
│   ├── Pneumonia\
│── val\
│   ├── Normal\
│   ├── Pneumonia\
│── test\
│   ├── Normal\
│   ├── Pneumonia\
```

## 🏗 **Installation & Setup**
1️⃣ Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chest-disease-detection.git
cd chest-disease-detection
```
2️⃣ Install dependencies  
```bash
pip install torch torchvision streamlit tqdm matplotlib
```
3️⃣ Train the model  
```bash
python train_chest_cnn.py
```
4️⃣ Run the Streamlit UI

```

---

## ⚙ **Model Training**
The CNN model is trained with:  
📌 **Data Augmentation** (Random crop, horizontal flip)  
📌 **CrossEntropy Loss**  
📌 **Adam Optimizer** (`lr=0.001`)  
📌 **50 Epochs with Early Stopping**  

---

## 📊 **Results**
✅ **Training Accuracy:** **79**  
✅ **Validation Accuracy:** **79**  
✅ **Test Accuracy:** **78**  

> *(Replace "XX" with actual results after training.)*
